## Pacman Dupe Clock
## Eryka Tommy

Initially I wanted to create a clock very similar to the game Pacman. I wanted the ghosts to chase pacman around and create an array of x and y values for pacman to follow so that he had differnet routes to follow so it looked somewhat random. I soon found this to be a little more cmplicated than anticipated so I simplified it a little using examples shown in class demos that being the TWO_PI example shown to make an object swing back and forth. I also stuck to one straigh route for pacmn to follow as it was easier to code and looked cleaner. 

In later class sessions I began working on my maeda clock follwoing one of the examples given. I used the idea of creating lots of ellipses to form the digits of a clock and experimented further by implementing a if staement to change the colour of the background in a strobe type effect switching between 2 colours.

Towards the end I began thinking of alarm ideas. Initially I wanted  very similar to the game having the ghosts chace pacman then when the alarm is on evrything inverst and pacman can now chase and eat the ghosts and gain more points. I decided to simplify it and make it more obviious by making the ghosts grow bigger and the numbers colours invert and strobe or even have a fill circle in the middle like pacman slowly open like when it dies in the game and display the message "game over".
